The Simple Bit is the online home page of Brian M. Hofmeister, a developer from Minnesota.  With more than two decades of software experience in a wide variety of environments, Brian wants to showcase his passion and love for the world of technology in these pages.

I've built this site using Jekyll and its default Minima theme. I plan to customize the site over time, but since I'm not a web designer, I wanted a simple and clean starting point, and I hope to grow and learn over time.
