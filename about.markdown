<p>The Simple Bit is the online home page of Brian M. Hofmeister, a developer from Minnesota.</p>

<p>With more than two decades of software experience in a wide variety of environments, Brian wants to showcase his passion and love for the world of technology in these pages.</p>

<p>I've built this site using Jekyll and its default Minima theme. I plan to customize the site over time, but since I'm not a web designer, I wanted a simple and clean starting point, and I hope to grow and learn over time.</p>
