Welcome to The Simple Bit. My name is Brian M. Hofmeister, and I'm a software developer from Minnesota, USA.

My goals for this site are to share my passion for software and technology, and also to share my progress and thoughts while I learn new skills.

I've built this site using Jekyll and its default Minima theme. I plan to customize the site over time, but since I'm not a web designer, I wanted a simple and clean starting point, and I hope to grow and learn over time.
