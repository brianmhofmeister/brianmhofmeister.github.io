I live in Minnesota. I was born and raised here. Like many folks here, and around the country, and indeed around the world, I am heartbroken at the recent spate of racially charged confrontations and killings. The death of George Floyd here in my home state has left me to reflect upon my part in the history of racial inequity and racial bias in the United States. George Floyd is the latest in a number of incidents of black men, unarmed, killed at the hands of law enforcement in Minneapolis. Jamar Clark, Thurman Blevins, and Philando Castile were others in recent years. The videos of Castile's and Floyd's final moments offer a crushing view of the imbalance of justice in our communities.

As a white male, I cannot deny the position of privilege I was born into in America. I do not feel the burden of worry about being chased down and shot while jogging. I do not worry that a woman in the park will call police and report that I threatened her because I asked her to leash her dog according to park rules. I do not worry that police will handcuff me and kneel on my neck for nearly nine minutes while I scream in anquish for a chance to breathe, and for my mother, and for my life. In the past several weeks I have been absorbed with reading stories of how the American experience for black Americans is so very different from mine. I want to learn about allyship, and I want to hear the stories of what it's like for black folks in my own community and all around this country. I want to challenge my own unconscious bias, I know it's there, and I want to learn how to defeat it.

Last night I watched the 2016 documentary "13th" about the criminalization of being black in America. It was startling in ways, and quite sadly not entirely surprising. The history of America is rife with immoral and tragic human tales.  My ignorance to some of that history is appalling to me. I need to learn more.

I want America to live up to its promise as a beacon to the oppressed. I do not want to continue to live in an America that is oppressive.  I stand with the Black Community. I will use my vote as an American to choose candidates who can create change, I will support black or brown candidates who can level the playing field by getting us closer to the ideal of equal representation in city, state, and federal government. We need voices in government willing to right the wrongs of our past, we need to hear those voices, to lift them up. We need to be better.

Black. Lives. Matter.
