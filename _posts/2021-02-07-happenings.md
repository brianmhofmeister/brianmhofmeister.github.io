## Since Last Time
It has been quite a while since I've posted here on The Simple Bit. The past many months have been some of the most extraordinary, in terms of life, and work, that I just have not really taken the time to put thoughts into words. I am hopeful to do so more often again, I would like writing to become a near-daily exercise.

Well the pandemic rages on. There are signs of hope, glimmers of it really, in the form of the vaccines being distributed around the nation, and the world. It will certainly take some time before the vaccine reaches all of us, and in the meantime I am content to continue avoiding large crouds and whatnot. Peace and quiet is not a bad thing.

## Work
So last year in May, I was laid off from a good job working with a team of people I absolutely loved. The work was good, but nothing terribly exciting. I tried perhaps too hard to make it more exciting, and perhaps that is why I was let go. I was perhaps too aggressive in my attempts to re-think everything. That is my nature.

A couple of months later I landed a new job doing something new and exciting. I get to work from home full time too, which is an added bonus as I like the short commute. I had a 90 mile each-way commute for a while, and I will avoid doing that again for the rest of my career.

Anyway, the new job is full-stack development, which is pretty new for me. I have some front end experience, but not a lot, and mostly with older techniques and technologies (JSP, AngularJS -- pre-Typescript). I also had no backend JavaScript experience. I've been mostly a Java guy, and a lot of older technologies like C/C++ and RPG (the language, not the games).

I have to say, moving into full stack JS has been awesome. The feedback loops are super short. We can iterate pretty quickly. I am still learning a lot of the nuances of Node and React, but they've been very awesome overall.

Perhaps best of all, since I've started this work, I have been taking a very hard look at the full-stack technologies that are available. Certainly Node and React have been my focus, but I'm starting to play with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), and I certainly want to take advantage of [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and I'm looking at some of the newer development tools like [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) and [es-build](https://esbuild.github.io/). I'm listening to ton of podcasts and learning about all kinds of new stuff that's out there. That's all great, but it can be overwhelming. For now I'm going to focus on React and will try to document some of the new and cool things I'm learning and figuring out. I'm not going to be changing the world, but there's some neat stuff in React, it is a very well designed library.

## Learning React
When I got the job last July, I had done quite a bit of reading about React by that point, and I've been listening to [Syntax](https://syntax.fm) for long enough to have gotten at least a few pointers and ideas along the way. But I hadn't written any code.

I'm grateful that React is relatively straightforward. Most of stuff I've run into has been class components, but I have taken immediately to functional components. Learning React hooks has also made a world of difference to me, as I believe the combination of functional components with hooks allow us to create much more intentional and declarative code.  React was intended, after all, to provide a declarative approach to UI development.  I'll put together some examples for my next post.

I'm excited to be getting a taste of what's happening on the modern web. With new tools. languages, and techniques, we're becoming more and more productive. I hope to learn and share some things about my personal productivity journey as well.

Until next time. Be well. Be Safe. Be loved.
