Life is a journey.

I began work on this site with two principal goals in mind:

1. To learn some new things about web site development, and to have a place to put them into practice.
2. To write about and showcase my years of experience and new skills that I'm working on learning.

Millions of people are losing their jobs right now, and sadly, I've become one of them. This challenge presents a great opportunity, however.  I hope to learn some new skills, build on some existing skills, and share my journey toward what's next with this simple blog.

There's no way to tell what will come. Today is a blessing, and I'm grateful to be healthy and learning.

Cheers!
