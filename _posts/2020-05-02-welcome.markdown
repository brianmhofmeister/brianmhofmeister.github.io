Hello!

Technology has fascinated me since I was just a boy.  At about age nine I started to learn programming with Apple BASIC.  It was a modest beginning, and since then my passion for computing and technology has only grown.

Welcome and thanks for joining me as I attempt to document some of the trends, techniques, and trials as I continue my engineering journey in life.
